Two scenarios:
    - Building for the same machine.
    - Building for another machine.

Because yarr2 is a LKM it needs the kernel's headers and configuration file.
Typically the formers are at /usr/src/linux-headers-<version> and the later at
/lib/modules/<version>/build/.config or /boot/config-<version>.

Nevermind, when building yarr2 for the current machine (native compile) running
make on the top-level directory should be enough.

When building for another machine (cross-compile) the header files of the
version of the kernel running in that machine and its config files need to be
in the local machine. Given that prerequisite, you can build yarr2 by running
make KVERSION=<version> on the top-level directory.

Examples:
    - Native build:
        - $ make

    - Cross-compile:
        - $ make KVERSION=5.0.0-36-generic
