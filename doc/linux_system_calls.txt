By the time I'm writing this document I'm working with kernel 5.0.0. All this
information may become outdated in the future, but hopefully will still be
useful.

This is the best resource I found on the internet about this topic:
https://blog.packagecloud.io/eng/2016/04/05/the-definitive-guide-to-linux-system-calls/

It is kind of outdated though, but still useful.


--- How system calls are actually called in x86 ---

There are 3 ways of requesting the kernel for a system call:
    - IRQ 0x80
    - Sysenter instruction
    - Syscall instruction

Interruption 0x80 is handled by an interrupt handler configured by the kernel
at startup. This is done by function...
