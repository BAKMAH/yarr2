---Snake Case ---

Example: func_name()

Function is internal to yarr2 and can be used across the module. It should be
found declared in a header file.

--- Leading underscores with snake case ---

Example: __func_name()

Function is internal just to the translation unit (i.e. the C file, although
this is not fully correct). It should not be present in any header file. It
should use exactly 2 underscores.

--- Camel case ---

Example: funcName()

Function is external to yarr2. Users of yarr2 (tools developers) would be the
ones using it. It should be present in a header file.
