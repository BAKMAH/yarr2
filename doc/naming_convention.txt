---Snake-case ---

Example: func_name()

Function is internal to yarr2 and can be used across the module. It should be
found declared in a header file.

--- Leading underscores with snake-case ---

Example: __func_name()

Function is internal just to the translation unit (i.e. the C file, although
this is not fully correct). It should not be present in any header file. It
should use exactly 2 underscores. It also should be static.

Exception: If for some reason the function already has leading underscores
don't use another pair to show it is internal. E.g. test functions in test/
folder.

--- Camel-case ---

Example: funcName()

Function is external to yarr2. Users of yarr2 (tools developers) would be the
ones using it. It should be present in a header file.

In general, if you are heavily using OOP paradigms, use this case.

*** Varibles ***

- Local variables should use snake-case.
- Global variables should be avoided... but if you don't they should be global
  to the translation unit (i.e. the C file) and therefore use __ before their
  name.
- Constants should be in caps.
